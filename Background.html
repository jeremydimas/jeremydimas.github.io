									<p>I graduated from Shafter High School in 2022 and was recognized as a California Scholarship Federation (CSF) member and was awarded the "Stringham Memorial Award for Scholastic Excellence" for being ranked the 3rd highest GPA (4.389) out of the 384 students in my graduating class. During my time in high school, I did Cross Country and Track and Field for four years, played Soccer for two years, participated in Key club and Relay for Life for two years, involved in the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Engineering program for 3 years, officer for the Associated Student Body (ASB) as the "Commissioner of Boys' Athletics" for two years, and was President of Cross Country and Track and Field my senior year. </p>

									<h2>McDonald's | 2020 - 2022</h2>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/mcds.HEIC" alt="" /></span>I began working at the McDonald's in Shafter in 2020 because of the C0VID-19 pandemic and since I had nothing to do at the time I thought working would be a new learning experience going into the real world. Honestly, working at McDonald's was both a fun and humbling experience. I met some of the most genuine hard-working people during my time there and grown into a more well-rounded and open-minded person because of my time working. My main role was working in the kitchen but overtime as I became more experienced I was able to evolve and adapt to taking upon other responsibilities such as taking drive-through orders and doing maintence work. (I'm going to be honest, there are some moments where even today I kind've wish I was still working there.)</p>

									<h2>Hobbies</h2>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/sierra.jpeg" alt="" /></span>My main hobby involves running, playing football (soccer), website-development, traveling, listening to music, and hanging out with friends. I average 60 miles a week of running and I'm currently just trying to maintain my physique for the upcoming track season in the Winter and Spring. For sports I live, breathe, and die football (soccer) and it's pretty much the only sport I watch on a daily basis. I'm a huge Barcelona, Argentina, and Messi fan and can talk all day long about it. I like to go exploring around LA and occassionally do this when I go out for a run and plan ahead scenic routes to make the run more enjoyable. I spend most of my time exploring Beverly Hills, Westwood, and Santa Monica. My goal is to eventually end up living in LA or New York after I graduate.</p>

									<h2>Clubs</h2>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/clubs.png" alt="" /></span>Currently at UCLA, I'm part of SOLES (the Society of Latinx Engineers and Scientists), the CEED (Center for Excellence in Engineering and Diversity) program, and run for the UCLA Club Track and Field team. Most of my friends from school are SOLES members and we spend most of our time in the CEED Center studying (procrastinating). For track, we have practice Tuesday through Thursday from 6pm - 7:30pm and distance runners have practice on Sunday from 9am - 10:30am occassionally. We have multiple races throughout the year and have many opportunities to travel and go up against highly competitive athletes across the area. There are many other great clubs on campus but these clubs are the ones that make me feel at home the most.</p>
